                        <p><span>Project Manager:</span> Me (Aviram Bhalla-Levine)<br>
                        <span>Project Members:</span> Christopher Garduno, Lemar Popal, Sarang Vadali<br>
                        <span>Class:</span> Principles of Engineering<br>
                        <span>Date:</span> 31 October 2014<br>
                        <span>Summary:</span> In this project, my team was asked to resolve a problem of lifting heavy weights at a construction site. We were required to design, build, and test a prototype winch for lifting. We were also asked to write a program to simulate the winch.<br>
						<span>My Role:</span> In the creation of this prototype, I was responsible for the program and most of the documentation. I wrote the design brief (a standard engineering procedure for defining problems) and the design statement (a standard engineering procedure for outlining solutions to problems). I also wrote and created the interface for the code. Lastly, I edited the calculations and wrote the final design paragraph. This was challenging because to fulfill the requirements, the simulation must have worked in a similar way to real life. The relations between voltage, mass, drum size, and motor speed all were relevant in writing the code for the simulation.<br>
						<span>What I learned:</span> As a coder, I learned how to rotate entities, how to create a line between entities, how to add formulas into movement, and how to end code loops under certain conditions. As a project manager, I improved on my skills in managing people. I was able to guide everyone on the team to finish the tasks assigned to them in time to effectively complete and then present our design. I made sure everyone stayed on task well and kept my team productive.<br>

                        <p><span>Project Manager:</span> Me (Aviram Bhalla-Levine)<br>
                        <span>Project Members:</span> Christopher Garduno, Lemar Popal, Sarang Vadali<br>
                        <span>Class:</span> Principles of Engineering<br>
                        <span>Date:</span> 14 March 2015<br>
                        <span>Summary:</span> In this project, my team was challenged with the problem of people needing to cross a river without the use of boats, or projectile transport.We were to design and test a prototype for a bridge to solve this problem using the West Point Bridge Design software.<br>
						<span>My Role:</span> In this project, I was responsible for over half of the documentation, and I created the final design solution. I wrote the design brief, illustrating the constraints and necessities of this project. I also facilitated the decision matrix process, where my team member and I decide what bridge we would further pursue in our designs to develop a solution. As we modified the design we chose in the decision matrix, I kept a careful eye on the various stresses on the members of the bridge, along with the cost to maximize the efficiency of our "funds." Additionally, as Project Manager, I made sure everyone was on task.<br>
						<span>What I learned:</span> As a technical writer, I was able to expand on my skills in documentation in this project as I didn't experience much trouble actually prototyping the design and therefore had more time to document. As a project manager, I learned to lead when there is only one other person and was also able to help other teams that were having difficulty.<br>
